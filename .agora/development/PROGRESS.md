- [x] Created an isolated Git worktree for Phase 1.
- [x] Inspected existing project registry, research artifacts, SQLite sessions, FastAPI routes, and tests.
- [x] Kiro completed a read-only Phase 1 specification review (0.34 credits reported by Kiro).
- [x] Implemented tool-neutral task manifest and lifecycle state machine.
- [x] Implemented SQLite task/event persistence and optimistic version checks.
- [x] Added REST endpoints and acceptance tests.
- [x] Migrated development commands to uv and generated `backend/uv.lock`.
- [x] Relevant regression suite: 18 passed, 1 dependency warning.
- [x] Full non-integration baseline: 163 passed, 37 pre-existing Windows/environment failures, 15 deselected.
- [x] Claude review pass 1: `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (project-id validation, sync DB in async routes, limits/order/tests).
- [x] Addressed all requested changes; relevant regression suite increased to 19 passed.
- [x] Claude review pass 2: `APPROVE` with no blocking correctness, transaction, concurrency, or security findings.
- [ ] Create the reviewed Phase 1 commit.

## 2026-07-13 — Network policy

- [x] Phase 1 foundation committed as `d92bf93` after Claude approval.
- [x] Confirmed external TCP/HTTPS works without a proxy.
- [x] Confirmed Agora inherited `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` and failed with HTTP 407.
- [x] Added configurable `web.network_mode`: `direct` ignores proxy variables; `system` inherits them.
- [x] Network policy tests and existing WebTools regression: 7 passed.
- [x] Claude review: `APPROVE`; no correctness, security, or compatibility defects found.
- [ ] Commit the reviewed network policy change.

## 2026-07-13 — Requirements Studio backend

- [x] Network policy committed as `797e8e9` after Claude approval.
- [x] Kiro produced the Phase 2 Requirements Studio specification (0.90 credits).
- [x] Added versioned structured specs, human approval/rejection, CR lifecycle, and per-requirement traceability.
- [x] Added the approved-spec gate for `requirements → design`.
- [x] Added REST endpoints and append-only `spec.*` / `cr.*` audit events.
- [x] Relevant regression suite: 28 passed, 1 dependency warning.
- [x] Claude review pass 1: `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (design-gate bypass, schema init, optimistic revision, rollback clarity).
- [x] Addressed all requested changes; relevant regression suite increased to 29 passed.
- [x] Claude review pass 2: `APPROVE`; no remaining high/medium defects.
- [ ] Commit the reviewed Requirements Studio backend.

### Full-suite baseline failure groups

- POSIX-only path and shell assertions (`/`, `pwd`, `sleep`) on Windows.
- External web tests blocked by the configured proxy.
- Agent profile YAML read with CP932 instead of UTF-8.
- Static frontend route tests run without a built `frontend/out` directory.

## Review Gate

No implementation commit may be created until:

1. Relevant automated tests pass.
2. Claude Code reviews the staged or working-tree diff independently.
3. Actionable findings are fixed or explicitly recorded with rationale.
4. Tests are rerun after fixes.
